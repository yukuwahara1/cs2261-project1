hunter-bear-ninja game

  The first project for Objected-Oriented Programming (Java) was making 
hunter-bear-ninja game that was same as rock-paper-scissors game in essence.
The game needed to be able to play as many times as the user wants and calculate
win or lose ratio at the end. The choice of the computer was decided randomly.
I used do while loop to make the game repeatable and counter to decide a winner. 
	One of the problems I had was that checking for invalid choice with string 
variables. A future goal is implementing an inteligent strategy to beat the 
player more and more that was assigned as extra credits. The inteligent strategy 
needs to learn from experience and the ratio of the computer winning should 
get higher every time they have another game.
